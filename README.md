# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Website  

## 🌟 Overview  
The **Stroke Prediction Website** helps users assess their risk of stroke based on key health factors such as **age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and lifestyle habits**. It employs a **Random Forest model** with **96% accuracy** to analyze user data and provide a **probability score** indicating stroke risk.  

## 🚀 Why This Website Matters  
Stroke is a **leading cause of death and disability worldwide** 🌍. Early detection of stroke risk can lead to preventive measures that may **save lives**. Our platform provides:  
✅ **Easy-to-use risk assessment** 📊  
✅ **Accurate predictions using machine learning** 🏆  
✅ **Personalized health insights** 💡  
✅ **Recommendations for stroke prevention** 🏥  

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. **User Input**: Users enter their health data (e.g., age, blood pressure, lifestyle).  
2. **Data Processing**: The system processes the input and applies data normalization.  
3. **Machine Learning Model**: A **Random Forest algorithm** analyzes the data and predicts stroke risk.  
4. **Results & Recommendations**: The system displays a risk probability and suggests preventive measures.
